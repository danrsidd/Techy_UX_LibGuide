# 'Techy' UX LibGuide
UX Research effort for Undergraduate technology students.

Techy was created in late 2019 to remedy the research related confusion among technological academics, or those pursuing undergraduate academic careers in disciplines like Information Technology & Informatics (ITI). As technological academics, we may not be adequately prepared to pursue research endeavors in accredited academic formats. Our lack of research instruction and awareness of useful research resources and their methods of utilization, hinder our abilities to gather the most effective information for our endeavors. As such, we may settle, or 'satisfice' our information needs, limiting the potential of our efforts. Techy aims to change this. Connecting students with a plethora of open-source, academically driven, and crowd-sourced content, Techy believes utilizing these resources in unison can greatly benefit each and every ITI student.
